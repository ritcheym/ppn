You can search for datasets directly on the Open Science Framework, or you can search for an article that interests you and see if their data are available. Articles in the journal Psychological Science are now required to share their data, so this journal might be a good place to start. Other journals may have similar requirements.\nYou are strongly encouraged to find this dataset well in advance of the final deadline and to review your choice with the instructor.\n\n\n2. Reproduce a set of analyses and visualizations in R\nUse what you have learned about data tidying, wrangling, visualization, and analysis to report on the published paper. Your report should include at least one table of summary statistics, one statistical analysis, and one data visualization that reproduces a figure from the paper. When possible, your work should reproduce what is already published.\nYou do not need to reproduce the entire paper. Most papers includes a large number of different experiments, analyses, and visualizations, some of which may go beyond the scope of what you have learned. You should select a subset of what they have done– perhaps the key data for answering their research question- and focus on that.\n\n\n3. Package everything into an R markdown report\nYour markdown report should include a description of the research question, a link to the dataset, as well as narrative details about what you’re doing at each step and what you have found.\nThe end result should be a reproducible report that would allow another person to download the dataset and run your code to obtain the same results.",

    "text": "Chapter summary\nThe chapter focuses on combining data from multiple tables (data frames) using dplyr’s join functions. The below summary was created in collaboration with Google Gemini.\nKey Concepts:\n\nRelational Data: Data is often stored in multiple tables that are related to each other.\nKey Variables: Columns that are common between tables and used to link them.\nJoining: The process of combining data from multiple tables based on key variables.\n\nTypes of Joins (with dplyr syntax):\n\nInner Join (inner_join()):\n\nReturns only rows where the key variable(s) match in both tables.\ninner_join(x, y, by = \"common_column\")\nExample: Combining customer orders with customer details, only for customers who have placed orders.\n\nLeft Join (left_join()):\n\nReturns all rows from the left table (x) and matching rows from the right table (y).\nIf a row in x has no match in y, NA values are added for y’s columns.\nleft_join(x, y, by = \"common_column\")\nExample: Adding information about departments to a list of employees, even if some departments have no employees.\n\nRight Join (right_join()):\n\nReturns all rows from the right table (y) and matching rows from the left table (x).\nIf a row in y has no match in x, NA values are added for x’s columns.\nright_join(x, y, by = \"common_column\")\n\nFull Join (full_join()):\n\nReturns all rows from both tables.\nNA values are added where there are no matches.\nfull_join(x, y, by = \"common_column\")\nExample: Combining customer data from two different databases, including all customers from both.\n\n\nSpecifying Key Variables:\n\nby Argument:\n\nSpecifies the key variable(s).\nIf the key variables have the same name in both tables, use by = \"column_name\".\nIf the key variables have different names, use by = c(\"x_column\" = \"y_column\").\n\n\nHandling Duplicate Column Names:\n\nIf non-key columns have the same name in both tables, dplyr will add suffixes (.x and .y) to distinguish them. You can change the suffixes by using the argument suffix = c(\".x\", \".y\").\n\nRow and Column Binding:\n\nbind_rows():\n\nCombines data frames vertically (adds rows).\nSyntax: bind_rows(df1, df2, ...)\nRequirement: Data frames must have the same columns (or columns that can be matched by name).\nExample: Merging daily sales data from multiple files.\nIf columns do not match, then NA values will be placed into the combined dataframe.\n\nbind_cols():\n\nCombines data frames horizontally (adds columns).\nSyntax: bind_cols(df1, df2, ...)\nRequirement: Data frames must have the same number of rows.\nCaveat: You will often want to use a join function instead of bind_cols.\n\n\nSet Operations:\n\nintersect():\n\nReturns the rows that are present in both data frames.\nSyntax: intersect(df1, df2)\nExample: Finding common customers between two lists.\n\nunion():\n\nReturns all unique rows from both data frames. This is similar to bind_rows except it removes duplicates.\nSyntax: union(df1, df2)\nExample: Combining customer lists from different sources, removing duplicates.\n\nsetdiff():\n\nReturns the rows that are present in the first data frame but not in the second.\nSyntax: setdiff(df1, df2)\nExample: finding all customers that are in the first customer list, but not the second.\n\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nJoins are essential for combining related data from multiple tables.\nJoins work with only two tables at a time. To combine multiple tables, use a pipe to connect multiple calls to a join function.\nThe by argument is crucial for specifying the key variables used to link tables.",

Open the R project called programming-foundations, and save today’s work in an R markdown report called workshop.Rmd.\n\nProgramming to the max\nCreate your own function for finding the maximum value of a vector. The input will be a vector, and the output should be the maximum value.\nDid you use the sort() function in your solution? Now try to write the function without it.\n\n\nBitcoin millionaires\nYou’ve taken the plunge and invested in Bitcoin. Write a function that calculates how much money you’ve made. The inputs should be the amount that you invested and the percentage increase since then, and the output should be your total profit.\nHow would you adjust this function if you wanted to calculate your profit over time, factoring in the rate of increase each month? Your inputs will be your initial investment, the rate of increase each month, and the number of months since your investment.\n\n\nPalindrome finder\nYou are obsessed with palindromes, and you want a function that will automatically figure out if a given word is a palindrome. Create a function that will return TRUE if the input is a palindrome and FALSE otherwise. Hint: you will probably have to look up some functions that will help you manipulate the text.\n\n\nTips\n\nFocus on creating a logical step-by-step plan. Think about what kind of input you need for each step, and how you will get that information from the previous step.\nWhile you’re brainstorming, come up with an example input for your function. For instance, for the custom max function, write out a short vector (e.g., c(5,1,4,10,2)), and then imagine what is going to happen to that vector at each step of your function.\nWhen testing your function, test out different types of inputs to make sure your function is generalizable to different situations. For example, for the custom max function, test out a vector with values less than 1, or all negative values, to make sure your code isn’t designed only for positive integers.",

Please also include a table of contents.\n\nAdditional programming practice\n\nWrite a function that counts the number of words contained in a string of text, such as, “Karma is my boyfriend, karma is a god, karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend. Karma’s a relaxing thought. Aren’t you envious that for you it’s not?” Hint: You will probably want to use the strsplit command. Read the help page or do a search to find out more about this function. How would you adapt this function to tell you how many times a particular word (e.g., “karma”) appears?\nWrite some code to store the numbers from 1 to 100 in a vector with the following constraints. If the number can be divided by three evenly, then store the word “Fizz” instead of the number. If the number can be divided by five evenly, then store the word “Buzz” instead of the number. Finally, if the number can be divided by three and five evenly, then store “FizzBuzz” instead of the number. For example, the first five elements of your vector should look like this: c(1,2,\"Fizz\",4,\"Buzz\").\n\n\n\nData visualization example\n\nIn preparation for our transition to the data visualization module, find an example of a data visualization that you like. This can be from any source, but if you need some inspiration, here are a couple of galleries (one, two) showing off plots created with ggplot2. We’ll talk about when you might want to use different kinds of plots and how to create them in R. You should embed the plot into your R markdown report, either by downloading it or by linking to it directly. Here’s a reminder of how that works.\n\nSome of these problems were adapted from this website.",

The goal will be to provide you with the skillset to program experiments and data analyses, as well as an understanding of how these tools are used to facilitate modern research. We will begin with the basics of how to develop algorithms and implement them with programming logic. In a series of hands-on projects, students will learn to program web-based interactive experiments and to analyze psychology and neuroscience datasets using JavaScript and R. Additional topics will include data management, version control, strategies for code debugging, data visualization, and an introduction to machine learning and natural language processing techniques. This course is ideal for students with little to no programming experience, although prior training in statistics is strongly recommended."

You can read more about the dataset in the paper or in the README file associated with the data.\nFor each of the 6 subjects, there are 3 primary files: an anatomical brain image, a set of BOLD functional images, and the labels that indicate what the subject was viewing for each time-point. In addition, there are 5 mask files that correspond to different regions of interest (ROIs) within the ventral temporal cortex: the ventral temporal cortex (vt), face-sensitive areas (face_vt), house-sensitive areas (house_vt), and variations of those latter two areas."

    "text": "Weekly assignment\nFirst, make sure you have completed all of the exercises in the above chapters. We will have already completed most of them in class. All of the solutions should be included in your R markdown report. Then, solve these additional problems using the concepts you have learned in class. For now, you should avoid using other predefined functions unless noted below.\nAs always, your R markdown report should be organized with headings and comments explaining your work.\n\nWrite a function to find the sum of all integers between any two values. Start by writing out your plan in comment form, and then fill in the code.\nList all of the prime numbers from 1 to 1000. Start by writing out your plan in comment form, and then fill in the code.\n\nCreate a function is_prime() that helps you solve this problem.\n\nWrite your own functions to give descriptive statistics for a vector variable storing multiple numbers. Write functions for the following without using R intrinsics: mean, mode, median, range, standard deviation\n\nIt’s ok to use sum() and length() in your solutions.\nFor at least one of these, see if you can come up with two different solutions.\nThe output should be a vector with the descriptive statistics, with names included (refer back to the Vectors chapter).\n\nImagine you are writing a program to help you process data from a survey that you ran.\n\nYou have vectors containing the ages of 200 participants, their identified gender labels, and their responses to a 10-item survey indexing mental health. Note that you should exclude anyone with missing survey responses.\nYou want the descriptive statistics for an overall mental health score, across everybody as well as split by gender (here, including male, female, and non-binary).\nYou also want to run a t-test comparing mental health scores specifically for males and females between ages 18-24.\nMake a plan for how you would implement this program, listing out the steps in order as well as what output you would need to pass from one step to the next. You can write this in pseudo-code - in other words, you don’t have to write any actual syntax, only the logical list of steps as a series of comments that you could use to structure your code. Be as specific and as granular as possible.\n\n\nSome of these problems were adapted from this website.",

The below summary was created in collaboration with Google Gemini.\nKey Concepts:\n\nTidy Data: A standard way of structuring datasets that makes them easier to manipulate and analyze.\nPrinciples of Tidy Data:\n\nEach variable forms a column.\nEach observation forms a row.\nEach type of observational unit forms a table.\n\nReshaping Data: Transforming data from a wide format (multiple variables in columns) to a long format (multiple observations in rows), or vice versa.\n\nKey Functions from tidyr:\n\npivot_longer():\n\nConverts data from wide to long format.\nSyntax: pivot_longer(data, cols, names_to, values_to)\n\ncols: Columns to pivot.\nnames_to: Name of the new column that will contain the pivoted column names.\nvalues_to: Name of the new column that will contain the pivoted values.\n\nExample: Transforming columns representing measurements at different time points into rows.\n\npivot_wider():\n\nConverts data from long to wide format.\nSyntax: pivot_wider(data, names_from, values_from)\n\nnames_from: Column whose values will become column names.\nvalues_from: Column whose values will populate the new columns.\n\nExample: Transforming rows representing different categories into columns.\n\nseparate():\n\nSplits a single column into multiple columns.\nSyntax: separate(data, col, into, sep)\n\ncol: Column to separate.\ninto: Vector of new column names.\nsep: Separator character or regular expression.\n\nExample: Splitting a date column into year, month, and day columns.\n\ndrop_na():\n\nRemoves rows with missing values (NA).\nSyntax: drop_na(data, ...)\n...: Optional columns to check for NAs. If empty, checks all columns.\n\n\nPractical Applications:\n\nPreparing data for analysis and visualization.\nStandardizing data formats for consistency.\nReshaping data to meet the requirements of specific functions or packages.\n\nKey Takeaways:\n\nTidy data is essential for efficient data analysis.\ntidyr provides powerful tools for reshaping data.\nUnderstanding pivot_longer() and pivot_wider() is crucial for transforming data between wide and long formats.\ndrop_na() is useful for cleaning data.\n\nAdditional Concepts Related to Processing fMRI Data:\n\nNIfTI file: A common file format for storing MRI data.\nAnatomical image: An image that maps out the anatomical structures of the brain due to its sensitivity to differences between tissue types, e.g., gray and white matter. Typically only one anatomical image is collected, with high spatial resolution to visualize brain structures.\nFunctional image: An image that measures the BOLD (blood oxygen level dependent) signal, which is used as a proxy for brain activity. Typically many functional images are collected to capture how the BOLD signal changes over time, e.g., while a participant completes a cognitive task. Functional images are typically lower in spatial resolution than the anatomical image.\nVoxel: The spatial unit of measurement for MRI, i.e., a volumetric (3-D) pixel. The smaller the voxel, the higher the resolution and the clearer the image.\nTime-point: Related to the temporal unit of measurement for functional MRI. We collect many functional images, one per time-point.\nTime-series: The ordered collection of time-points, reflecting the time-course of the BOLD signal.",

    "text": "Questions\n\nQuestion 1: Code Breakers\nTurn any normal english text into an encrypted version of the text, and be able to turn any decrypted text back into normal english text. A simple encryption would be to scramble the alphabet such that each letter corresponds to a new randomly chosen (but unique) letter. You should have a function for each, as well as some tests that demonstrate how it works.\n\n\nQuestion 2: Playing Games\nSolve 1 of the following 3 game problems. You can solve a second for 10 bonus points.\n\nSnakes and ladders\nYour task here is to write an algorithm that can simulate playing the depicted Snakes and Ladders board depicted here. You should assume that each roll of the dice produces a random number between 1 and 6. After you are able to simulate one played game, you will then write a loop to simulate 1000 games, and estimate the average number of dice rolls needed to successfully complete the game.\n\n\nTic Tac Toe\nImagine that two players make completely random choices when playing tic-tac-toe. Each game will either end in a draw or one of the two players will win. Create a simulation of this “random” version of tic-tac-toe. Out of 10,000 simulations, what proportion of the time is the game won versus drawn?\n\n\nSudoku\nSudoku is a logic puzzle in which the goal is to fill a 9 x 9 grid with numbers 1 to 9. The board has 9 rows, 9 columns, and is divided into 9 3x3 boxes. The catch is that each number must appear only once per row, column, and box. Start with a Sudoku puzzle that has some numbers filled in - here is an example, but you can use any starting puzzle. Write some code to solve the puzzle. To do so, you will probably want to write a function to make sure a number “works” for a particular spot, and then keep trying to add numbers until you fill in the entire puzzle.\n\n\n\nQuestion 4: Find the Missing Number\nYou have a vector listing numbers from 1 to 100. You shuffle it randomly, and then— oh no, one of the numbers has gone missing! Write a function that will generate a randomized vector that is missing one value. Then write a function that can find the missing number. The second function should generalize to work any vector that includes consecutive numbers but is missing one value.\n\n\nQuestion 5: Wordle Thought Experiment\nThought experiment: How would you build a Wordle solver? Write out the algorithm in pseudo code. Think about what functions you’d like to be able to use (whether they already exist or not), and how you would chain them together to solve the puzzle.\n\nProblems were adapted from this list of Practice Problems and daily.dev blog.",

For the other assessments, you will complete weekly quizzes as well as a final exam. The weekly assignments and quizzes are low-stakes opportunities to build your skills and test your knowledge. The projects and final exam are designed to showcase what you have learned.\nBoston College defines credit hours in terms of how much in- and out-of-class time is spent on a course per week. You should expect to spend a minimum of 6 out-of-class hours per week on this 3-credit course. Much of your learning will occur as you work through the assignments outside of the classroom.\nYour active participation during class will be an important way of demonstrating your learning. You will receive full participation credit if you make, on average, one substantive contribution per class discussion and actively participate in all of the in-class activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAbsence policy: If you must miss a class due to illness or other serious reasons, you are responsible for familiarizing yourself with that week’s material and completing any in-class exercises on your own. In order to make up your attendance credit, you must submit for review any code that steps through these exercises.

    "section": "Acceptable (and unacceptable) use of generative AI",
    "text": "Acceptable (and unacceptable) use of generative AI\nArtificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, can be useful for generating and understanding computer code. However, they have the potential to interfere with learning when they are used indiscriminately. Learning requires making mistakes. Learning requires critical thinking about the process, not just finding the solution. In this course, you will be permitted to use AI tools in most cases, but you are strongly encouraged to use them in ways that facilitate your own learning.\nWhat does this mean? Most importantly, it means trying to solve the problem first on your own. If you can’t remember the exact syntax you want to use, write out what you can remember. Get the structure of your code in place. Use the help function in R to look at examples of how different functions can be used. Find examples online, and then figure out how to adapt them to your own code. If it still doesn’t work, then an AI tool can help you debug the problem.\nAnother way that AI tools can facilitate your learning is by annotating computer code. If you come across some code that you do not fully understand, have the AI tool explain it to you.\nA few caveats: For some assignments, I may explicitly forbid the use of AI tools as part of the learning exercise. In addition, you will not be able to use AI tools to complete your quizzes or final exam. For this reason, it is all the more important that you do not let AI tools interfere with your learning. Finally, you are expected to be able to explain all of your code, whether or not you used an AI tool, and I may ask you to do so.\nAny and all use of AI tools should be described in a disclosure statement included in your assignment (e.g., “ChatGPT was used to debug lines 15-20,” or “Microsoft Copilot was used to help figure out the tricky bit of syntax on line 17.”). This can be included in-line with your code or as a separate statement at the end.\nIf any part of this is confusing or uncertain, please reach out to me for a conversation before submitting your work. Also, please be aware that other instructors may have different policies regarding the acceptable use of AI."
