You can search for datasets directly on the Open Science Framework, or you can search for an article that interests you and see if their data are available. Articles in the journal Psychological Science are now required to share their data, so this journal might be a good place to start. Other journals may have similar requirements.\nYou are strongly encouraged to find this dataset well in advance of the final deadline and to review your choice with the instructor.\n\n\n2. Reproduce a set of analyses and visualizations in R\nUse what you have learned about data tidying, wrangling, visualization, and analysis to report on the published paper. Your report should include at least one table of summary statistics, one statistical analysis, and one data visualization that reproduces a figure from the paper. When possible, your work should reproduce what is already published.\nYou do not need to reproduce the entire paper. Most papers includes a large number of different experiments, analyses, and visualizations, some of which may go beyond the scope of what you have learned. You should select a subset of what they have done– perhaps the key data for answering their research question- and focus on that.\n\n\n3. Package everything into an R markdown report\nYour markdown report should include a description of the research question, a link to the dataset, as well as narrative details about what you’re doing at each step and what you have found.\nThe end result should be a reproducible report that would allow another person to download the dataset and run your code to obtain the same results.",

Open the R project called programming-foundations, and save today’s work in an R markdown report called workshop.Rmd.\n\nProgramming to the max\nCreate your own function for finding the maximum value of a vector. The input will be a vector, and the output should be the maximum value.\nDid you use the sort() function in your solution? Now try to write the function without it.\n\n\nBitcoin millionaires\nYou’ve taken the plunge and invested in Bitcoin. Write a function that calculates how much money you’ve made. The inputs should be the amount that you invested and the percentage increase since then, and the output should be your total profit.\nHow would you adjust this function if you wanted to calculate your profit over time, factoring in the rate of increase each month? Your inputs will be your initial investment, the rate of increase each month, and the number of months since your investment.\n\n\nPalindrome finder\nYou are obsessed with palindromes, and you want a function that will automatically figure out if a given word is a palindrome. Create a function that will return TRUE if the input is a palindrome and FALSE otherwise. Hint: you will probably have to look up some functions that will help you manipulate the text.\n\n\nTips\n\nFocus on creating a logical step-by-step plan. Think about what kind of input you need for each step, and how you will get that information from the previous step.\nWhile you’re brainstorming, come up with an example input for your function. For instance, for the custom max function, write out a short vector (e.g., c(5,1,4,10,2)), and then imagine what is going to happen to that vector at each step of your function.\nWhen testing your function, test out different types of inputs to make sure your function is generalizable to different situations. For example, for the custom max function, test out a vector with values less than 1, or all negative values, to make sure your code isn’t designed only for positive integers.",

Karma’s a relaxing thought. Aren’t you envious that for you it’s not?” Hint: You will probably want to use the strsplit command. Read the help page or do a search to find out more about this function. How would you adapt this function to tell you how many times a particular word (e.g., “karma”) appears?\nWrite some code to store the numbers from 1 to 100 in a vector with the following constraints. If the number can be divided by three evenly, then store the word “Fizz” instead of the number. If the number can be divided by five evenly, then store the word “Buzz” instead of the number. Finally, if the number can be divided by three and five evenly, then store “FizzBuzz” instead of the number. For example, the first five elements of your vector should look like this: c(1,2,\"Fizz\",4,\"Buzz\").\n\n\n\nData visualization example\n\nIn preparation for our transition to the data visualization module, find an example of a data visualization that you like. This can be from any source, but if you need some inspiration, here are a couple of galleries (one, two) showing off plots created with ggplot2. We’ll talk about when you might want to use different kinds of plots and how to create them in R. You should embed the plot into your R markdown report, either by downloading it or by linking to it directly. Here’s a reminder of how that works.\n\nSome of these problems were adapted from this website.",

The goal will be to provide you with the skillset to program experiments and data analyses, as well as an understanding of how these tools are used to facilitate modern research. We will begin with the basics of how to develop algorithms and implement them with programming logic. In a series of hands-on projects, students will learn to program web-based interactive experiments and to analyze psychology and neuroscience datasets using JavaScript and R. Additional topics will include data management, version control, strategies for code debugging, data visualization, and an introduction to machine learning and natural language processing techniques. This course is ideal for students with little to no programming experience, although prior training in statistics is strongly recommended."

The goal will be to provide you with the skillset to program experiments and data analyses, as well as an understanding of how these tools are used to facilitate modern research. We will begin with the basics of how to develop algorithms and implement them with programming logic. In a series of hands-on projects, students will learn to program web-based interactive experiments and to analyze psychology and neuroscience datasets using JavaScript and R. Additional topics will include data management, version control, strategies for code debugging, data visualization, and an introduction to machine learning and natural language processing techniques. This course is ideal for students with little to no programming experience, although prior training in statistics is strongly recommended."

For the exercises, you will have weekly assignments in addition to a midterm project and final project. You will also present your final project to the class. For the other assessments, you will complete weekly quizzes as well as a final exam. The weekly assignments and quizzes are low-stakes opportunities to build your skills and test your knowledge. The projects and final exam are designed to showcase what you have learned.\nBoston College defines credit hours in terms of how much in- and out-of-class time is spent on a course per week. You should expect to spend a minimum of 6 out-of-class hours per week on this 3-credit course. Much of your learning will occur as you work through the assignments outside of the classroom.\nYour active participation during class will be an important way of demonstrating your learning. You will receive full participation credit if you make, on average, one substantive contribution per class discussion and actively participate in all of the in-class activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAbsence policy: If you must miss a class due to illness or other serious reasons, you are responsible for familiarizing yourself with that week’s material and completing any in-class exercises on your own. In order to make up your attendance credit, you must submit for review any code that steps through these exercises. If you miss more than 2 classes without a dean’s letter excusing your absences, you will no longer be able to make up your attendance credit."

Every student will be allowed one “free” late turn-in that they can use for any of the weekly assignments. Assignments will generally be due by noon the day before class.\nGrading for the weekly assignments will be based on satisfactory completion. In other words, you will get full credit as long as you have completed the assignment on time and, by my assessment, would have earned at least a 70% on it. Note that the midterm project and final project will be fully graded following a separate rubric.\nQuizzes will be taken in class unless otherwise arranged with the instructor. Your final quiz grade will drop your lowest 2 quiz scores over the course of the semester."

    "section": "Acceptable (and unacceptable) use of generative AI",
    "text": "Acceptable (and unacceptable) use of generative AI\nArtificial intelligence (AI) tools, such as ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot, can be useful for generating and understanding computer code. However, they have the potential to interfere with learning when they are used indiscriminately. Learning requires making mistakes. Learning requires critical thinking about the process, not just finding the solution. In this course, you will be permitted to use AI tools in most cases, but you are strongly encouraged to use them in ways that facilitate your own learning.\nWhat does this mean? Most importantly, it means trying to solve the problem first on your own. If you can’t remember the exact syntax you want to use, write out what you can remember. Get the structure of your code in place. Use the help function in R to look at examples of how different functions can be used. Find examples online, and then figure out how to adapt them to your own code. If it still doesn’t work, then an AI tool can help you debug the problem.\nAnother way that AI tools can facilitate your learning is by annotating computer code. If you come across some code that you do not fully understand, have the AI tool explain it to you.\nA few caveats: For some assignments, I may explicitly forbid the use of AI tools as part of the learning exercise. In addition, you will not be able to use AI tools to complete your quizzes or final exam. For this reason, it is all the more important that you do not let AI tools interfere with your learning. Finally, you are expected to be able to explain all of your code, whether or not you used an AI tool, and I may ask you to do so.\nAny and all use of AI tools should be described in a disclosure statement included in your assignment (e.g., “ChatGPT was used to debug lines 15-20,” or “Microsoft Copilot was used to help figure out the tricky bit of syntax on line 17.”). This can be included in-line with your code or as a separate statement at the end.\nIf any part of this is confusing or uncertain, please reach out to me for a conversation before submitting your work. Also, please be aware that other instructors may have different policies regarding the acceptable use of AI."

Please reach out by going to the Center for Student Wellness website to schedule a virtual meeting with a staff member, Wellness Coach, and for health and wellness information.\nI ask that you inform me— with as much advance notice as possible— if you become unable to engage with the class material in the way it is outlined on this syllabus so that we can work together to develop a plan. I also hope you will view me as a part of your support network at Boston College; please reach out if you have questions or concerns, or would like help getting connected with other campus resources."
